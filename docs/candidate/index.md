# What Candidates Experience

This page walks you through the candidate's journey on Recruit41 — from receiving an interview link to completing their session with Kiran. Use this to set expectations, answer candidate questions, and troubleshoot common issues.

!!! info "Why This Matters"
    Understanding the candidate experience helps you provide better support, set accurate expectations in your communications, and quickly resolve any issues candidates report.

## Before the Interview

### Browser & Device Requirements

Candidates must use the following setup:

| Requirement | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Browser** | Google Chrome (other browsers are not supported) |
| **OS** | Windows, macOS, or Linux — desktop/laptop only |
| **Device** | Personal laptop recommended (corporate firewalls may interfere) |

!!! warning "Corporate Laptops"
    Most corporate laptops have firewalls and proxy settings that can interfere with the platform. If a candidate reports connectivity issues, ask whether they're using a corporate device.

### Equipment Setup

Candidates need:

- A working **camera** and **microphone** (Bluetooth headphones recommended)
- The ability to **share their full screen** (required for coding interviews)
- A **quiet, well-lit environment** with minimal background noise

Candidates can test their setup at [webcammictest.com](https://webcammictest.com) before the interview.

### Practice Option

Candidates can familiarise themselves with the platform using a mock interview at [demo.recruit41.com](https://demo.recruit41.com/). Consider including this link in your invitation emails.

## During the Interview

### Camera Positioning

Candidates are expected to keep their camera on throughout the interview. The correct setup:

- **Full upper body visible** — face, arms, and hands must be in frame
- **Approximately 3 feet from screen** — close enough to be heard, far enough to be seen
- **Pen & paper allowed** — but hands, pen, and paper must remain visible
- **Coding exception** — candidates may move closer during coding sections

!!! tip "Positioning Reference"

    **Correct Position**

    ![Hands visible](../assets/images/hands_visible.png){ width="45%" }
    ![Important positioning](../assets/images/imppic.png){ width="45%" }

    Sitting at a proper distance, hands visible.

    **Incorrect Position**

    ![Wrong poses](../assets/images/wrong_poses.png){ width="70%" }

    Sitting too close, hands not visible, using a mobile phone, looking away, or not wearing headphones.

### How Kiran Interacts with Candidates

- Kiran introduces itself when the candidate joins
- Candidates should respond in **complete sentences** (not 1-2 word answers) for better evaluation
- If Kiran appears unresponsive, candidates can say **"Hey Kiran, are you there?"**
- Candidates should wait for Kiran to finish speaking before responding

### Meeting Controls

- Candidates must **stay on the interview tab** throughout the session
- To end the session, candidates use the **"End Meeting"** button on the control panel
- **Live chat support** is available on the control panel for immediate assistance
- Email support: [support@recruit41.com](mailto:support@recruit41.com)

## Interview Types

The candidate experience varies depending on the interview format you've configured:

### Conversational Interviews

- Kiran asks questions **verbally only** — nothing appears on screen
- Candidates respond by speaking naturally, like a real conversation
- Kiran asks follow-up questions based on responses

### Coding Interviews

- Programming problems appear **on screen**
- Candidates must **share their full screen** and use their own code editor/IDE
- Kiran may ask candidates to explain their approach verbally

### Conversational + Coding Interviews

- Starts with **conversational questions** (audio only)
- Kiran transitions to **coding problems** (displayed on screen)
- Candidates need to be prepared for both formats

!!! tip "Setting Expectations"
    Include the interview type in your invitation emails so candidates know what to prepare for. This reduces support requests and no-shows.

## Common Candidate Issues

These are the most frequent issues candidates report and how to advise them:

| Issue | Resolution |
| :--- | :--- |
| **No audio from Kiran** | Wait 10-15 seconds, then say "Hey Kiran, are you there?" Check audio settings. Rejoin if needed. |
| **No questions on screen** | Normal for conversational interviews — questions are verbal only. |
| **Coding problems won't load** | Use Google Chrome, refresh the page, check internet connection. |
| **Can't share screen** | Share entire screen (not a tab/window), grant browser permissions. |
| **Kiran says "Are you there?"** | Candidate's microphone isn't being detected — check mic permissions and default device. |
| **Disconnected mid-interview** | Rejoin using the same link within the stipulated time to continue. |
| **Camera not detected** | Select correct camera on pre-meeting page, close other apps using the camera. |

!!! info "Platform Issues Don't Affect Scores"
    Any platform-related errors will not negatively impact a candidate's application. You can reassure candidates of this.
