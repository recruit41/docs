!!! info "Quick Overview"
    This guide will help you prepare for your AI-powered interview with Kiran, our virtual interviewer. Following these guidelines will ensure a fair and effective evaluation of your skills.

## Before Your Interview

### Use Google Chrome Browser
- Our platform exclusively supports the official Google Chrome browser.
!!! warning "Unsupported Browsers"
    Please avoid using Chromium-based browsers (e.g., Brave, Arc), Safari, Microsoft Edge, or any mobile browsers.

!!! warning "Unsupported Operating Systems"
    The Recruit41 platform does not support mobile operating systems such as:
    
    - Android
    - iOS
    - iPadOS or any other mobile/tablet OS
    
Please use a desktop or laptop computer running macOS, Windows, or Linux for your interview. Attempting to join from a mobile device may result in technical issues or an inability to proceed with your interview.


### Check your Camera and Microphone
- **Working Equipment**: Ensure your camera and microphone are functioning correctly. Bluetooth headphones/earphones are recommended if available.

- **Bluetooth Users**: If using Bluetooth, set your devices as the default microphone and speaker in your operating system settings.

- **Test Your Setup**: Critically, test your camera and microphone at [webcammictest.com](https://webcammictest.com) well before your interview.

### Prepare for Screen Sharing
- During the interview, you might be asked to share your screen.

!!! danger "Important"
    You must share your entire screen (not just a tab or window). This is crucial for us to evaluate any code you write. Without full screen sharing, we cannot grade your code.

### Familiarize Yourself with Our Platform
- Practice with a mock interview at [https://demo.recruit41.com/](https://demo.recruit41.com/). This will help you get comfortable with audio/video controls, screen sharing, and other platform features.

### Suitable Interview Environment
- **Quiet & Distraction-Free**: Choose a location where you won't be interrupted.
- **Good Lighting**: Sit facing a light source so your face is clearly visible.
- **Minimize Background Noise**: Ensure a quiet setting for clear audio.

## During Your Interview

### Positioning the Camera
- **Clear View**: Your entire upper body (including face, arms, and hands) must be clearly visible to the interviewer.
- **Distance**: This typically means sitting approximately 3 feet or more away from your computer screen.
- **Pen & Paper**: You may use pen and paper, but ensure your hands, pen, and paper remain visible.
- **Exception for Coding**: When asked to write code, you may move closer to the screen.

- **If Kiran seems stuck**: If Kiran appears unresponsive, prompt it by saying, "Hey Kiran, are you there?"

### Communication Etiquette
- **Listen Actively**: Allow the interviewer to finish speaking before you respond.
- **Avoid Interruptions**: Refrain from interrupting the interviewer during their question.

### Meeting Controls
- **Do Not Refresh or Close**: Avoid closing the interview tab or hitting the refresh button.
- **Pausing/Ending**: If you need to stop or pause, use the "End Meeting" button located on the bottom control panel.

### Getting Support
- **Live Chat (Recommended)**: Reach our live support team via the chat option available on the bottom control panel for the fastest response.
- **Email**: Alternatively, you can email us at [support@recruit41.com](mailto:support@recruit41.com).
