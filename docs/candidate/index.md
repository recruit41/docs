We're excited to have you interview with us! To ensure a smooth and successful experience on the Recruit41 platform, please carefully review this guide.

!!! info "Quick Overview"
    This guide will help you prepare for your AI-powered interview with Kiran, our virtual interviewer. Following these guidelines will ensure a fair and effective evaluation of your skills.

## Before Your Interview

### Use Google Chrome Browser
- Our platform is optimized for the official Google Chrome browser.
!!! warning "Supported Browser"
    For the best experience, please use **Google Chrome**. Other browsers (Chromium-based browsers like Brave and Arc, Safari, Microsoft Edge, and mobile browsers) are currently not supported.

!!! warning "Supported Operating Systems"
    The Recruit41 platform is designed for desktop and laptop computers running **Windows, macOS, or Linux**. For the best experience, please use a desktop or laptop.

!!! warning "Personal Laptops Recommended"
    Most corporate laptops are configured with firewalls and proxy settings that can interfere with the Recruit41 platform. This may cause issues during your interview and could impact your score.

Please use a personal desktop or laptop computer for your interview. Attempting to join from a mobile device may result in technical issues.


### Check your Camera and Microphone
- **Working Equipment**: Ensure your camera and microphone are functioning correctly. Bluetooth headphones/earphones are recommended if available.

- **Bluetooth Users**: If using Bluetooth, set your devices as the default microphone and speaker in your operating system settings.

- **Test Your Setup**: Test your camera and microphone at [webcammictest.com](https://webcammictest.com) well before your interview.

### Prepare for Screen Sharing
- During the interview, you might be asked to share your screen.

!!! danger "Important"
    You must share your entire screen (not just a tab or window). This is crucial for us to evaluate any code you write. Without full screen sharing, we cannot grade your code.

### Familiarize Yourself with Our Platform
- Practice with a mock interview at [https://demo.recruit41.com/](https://demo.recruit41.com/). This will help you get comfortable with audio/video controls, screen sharing, and other platform features.

### Suitable Interview Environment
- **Quiet & Distraction-Free**: Choose a location where you won't be interrupted.
- **Good Lighting**: Sit facing a light source so your face is clearly visible.
- **Minimize Background Noise**: Ensure a quiet setting for clear audio.

## During Your Interview

### Positioning the Camera
- **Clear View**: Your entire upper body (including face, arms, and hands) must be clearly visible to the interviewer.
- **Distance**: This typically means sitting approximately 3 feet or more away from your computer screen.
- **Pen & Paper**: You may use pen and paper, but ensure your hands, pen, and paper remain visible.
- **Exception for Coding**: When asked to write code, you may move closer to the screen.

    **Incorrect Position**

    ![Wrong poses](../assets/images/wrong_poses.png){ width="70%" }

    Sitting too close, hands not visible, using your mobile phone, looking away during the interview and not wearing headphones.


### Interacting with Kiran, your AI Interviewer

- **Thoughtful Responses**: Respond with a few complete sentences rather than 1-2 word answers. This helps Kiran (and any human reviewers) understand your thought process.
- **If Kiran seems stuck**: If Kiran appears unresponsive, prompt it by saying, "Hey Kiran, are you there?"

### Communication Etiquette
- **Listen Actively**: Allow the interviewer to finish speaking before you respond.
- **Wait Your Turn**: Let the interviewer complete their question before responding.

### Meeting Controls
- **Keep Your Tab Open**: Stay on the interview tab throughout your session. If you need to stop, use the "End Meeting" button on the control panel.
- **Pausing/Ending**: If you need to stop or pause, use the "End Meeting" button located on the bottom control panel.

### Getting Support
- **Live Chat (Recommended)**: Reach our live support team via the chat option available on the bottom control panel for the fastest response.
- **Email**: Alternatively, you can email us at [support@recruit41.com](mailto:support@recruit41.com).
