Please use a desktop or laptop computer running macOS, Windows, or Linux for your interview. Attempting to join from a mobile device may result in technical issues or an inability to proceed with your interview.


### Check your Camera and Microphone
- **Working Equipment**: Ensure your camera and microphone are functioning correctly. Bluetooth headphones/earphones are recommended if available.

- **Bluetooth Users**: If using Bluetooth, set your devices as the default microphone and speaker in your operating system settings.

- **Test Your Setup**: Critically, test your camera and microphone at [webcammictest.com](https://webcammictest.com) well before your interview.

### Prepare for Screen Sharing
- During the interview, you might be asked to share your screen.

!!! danger "Important"
    You must share your entire screen (not just a tab or window). This is crucial for us to evaluate any code you write. Without full screen sharing, we cannot grade your code.

### Familiarize Yourself with Our Platform
- Practice with a mock interview at [https://demo.recruit41.com/](https://demo.recruit41.com/). This will help you get comfortable with audio/video controls, screen sharing, and other platform features.

### Suitable Interview Environment
- **Quiet & Distraction-Free**: Choose a location where you won't be interrupted.
- **Good Lighting**: Sit facing a light source so your face is clearly visible.
- **Minimize Background Noise**: Ensure a quiet setting for clear audio.

- **Distance**: This typically means sitting approximately 3 feet or more away from your computer screen.
- **Pen & Paper**: You may use pen and paper, but ensure your hands, pen, and paper remain visible.
- **Exception for Coding**: When asked to write code, you may move closer to the screen.

- **Pausing/Ending**: If you need to stop or pause, use the "End Meeting" button located on the bottom control panel.

### Getting Support
- **Live Chat (Recommended)**: Reach our live support team via the chat option available on the bottom control panel for the fastest response.
- **Email**: Alternatively, you can email us at [support@recruit41.com](mailto:support@recruit41.com).
