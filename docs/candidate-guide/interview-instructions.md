- **Avoid Interruptions**: Refrain from interrupting the interviewer during their question.

### 4. Technical Stability:

- **Pausing/Ending**: If you need to stop or pause, use the "End Meeting" button located on the bottom control panel.

### 5. Getting Support:
- **Live Chat (Recommended)**: Reach our live support team via the chat option available on the bottom control panel for the fastest response.
- **Email**: Alternatively, you can email us at [support@recruit41.com](mailto:support@recruit41.com).
