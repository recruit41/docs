# How to Test Before Going Live

Test your interviews before full launch to ensure a smooth candidate experience.

## Why Pilot Testing Matters

!!! danger "Always test before launching!"
    Untested interviews can lead to:

    - Technical issues frustrating candidates
    - Unclear questions causing confusion
    - Scoring problems affecting evaluations
    - Poor candidate experience damaging your brand

## The Four-Phase Approach

### Phase 1: Internal Testing

| Task | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| Run simulations | Complete 3-5 full test runs |
| Team testing | Have colleagues take the interview |
| Technical check | Verify all question types work |
| Timing check | Confirm duration is appropriate |

**Checklist:**

- [ ] All questions display correctly
- [ ] Timer works as expected
- [ ] Navigation is smooth
- [ ] Code editor functions properly (if applicable)
- [ ] Video/audio recording works
- [ ] Submission completes successfully

### Phase 2: Small Group Pilot

| Task | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| Select pilot group | Choose 5-10 real candidates |
| Monitor closely | Watch for technical issues in real-time |
| Gather feedback | Ask about their experience |
| Review results | Check score distribution and quality |

**Selection criteria for pilot candidates:**

- Mix of experience levels
- Different technical backgrounds
- Variety of time zones (if applicable)
- Candidates you can contact for feedback

### Phase 3: Review and Adjust

| Area | What to Check |
| :--- | :--- |
| Completion rate | Are candidates finishing? |
| Score distribution | Is it reasonable? |
| Candidate feedback | Any common complaints? |
| Technical issues | Any recurring problems? |

**Common adjustments:**

- Shorten sections that take too long
- Clarify confusing questions
- Adjust difficulty level
- Fix technical issues
- Improve instructions

### Phase 4: Full Launch

After successful pilot:

- Roll out to all candidates
- Continue monitoring completion rates
- Collect ongoing feedback
- Iterate based on data

## Running Simulations

### What to Check

| Check | What to Look For |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Timer** | Countdown works, warnings appear |
| **Navigation** | Next/back buttons work |
| **Questions** | Text renders correctly |
| **Attachments** | Images load, files downloadable |
| **Code Editor** | Syntax highlighting, execution works |
| **Video** | Camera prompt appears, recording works |
| **Submission** | Final submit completes without errors |

### Simulation Best Practices

1. **Complete the full interview** - Take it from start to finish
2. **Test edge cases** - Try unusual inputs
3. **Test on different devices** - Desktop, laptop, different browsers
4. **Time yourself** - Ensure duration is realistic
5. **Test as a real candidate would** - Follow all instructions

## Gathering Pilot Feedback

### Questions to Ask

**Technical Experience:**

- Did you encounter any technical issues?
- How was the video/audio quality?
- Did the code editor work well? (if applicable)

**Content Quality:**

- Were the questions clear?
- Was the difficulty level appropriate?
- Was there enough time for each section?

**Overall Experience:**

- How would you rate the overall experience (1-10)?
- What would you improve?
- Would you recommend this interview process?

### Feedback Collection Methods

- Post-interview survey (automated)
- Email follow-up
- Phone/video call for detailed feedback
- In-app feedback widget

## Common Pilot Issues and Solutions

| Issue | Solution |
| :--- | :--- |
| High abandonment rate | Shorten interview or add progress indicators |
| Low scores across the board | Criteria too strict - recalibrate |
| Technical complaints | Check browser requirements in communications |
| "Not enough time" | Extend section durations or reduce questions |
| Confusing questions | Rewrite for clarity, add examples |

## Metrics to Track During Pilot

| Metric | Target | Red Flag |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Completion rate | >70% | <50% |
| Average duration | Within 10% of expected | >20% over expected |
| Technical issue rate | <5% | >15% |
| Candidate satisfaction | >7/10 | <5/10 |
