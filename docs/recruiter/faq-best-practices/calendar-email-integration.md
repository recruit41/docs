## Email Best Practices

### Subject Lines

**Do:**
- Keep it clear and action-oriented
- Include the job title
- Create urgency without being pushy

**Don't:**
- Use ALL CAPS
- Add excessive punctuation!!!
- Use spam trigger words (FREE, URGENT, ACT NOW)

**Examples:**

| Good | Bad |
| :--- | :--- |
| "Complete your Software Engineer interview" | "URGENT: Interview waiting!!!" |
| "Reminder: 3 days left for your interview" | "Don't miss this opportunity!!!" |
| "Your interview link for [Company]" | "ACTION REQUIRED IMMEDIATELY" |

### Body Content

1. **Be concise** - Get to the point quickly
2. **Be friendly** - Warm but professional tone
3. **Be clear** - State exactly what action is needed
4. **Be helpful** - Include all necessary information

---

## Scheduling Considerations

### Setting Deadlines

- Give candidates at least **5-7 days** to complete
- Avoid deadlines on weekends or holidays
- Consider time zones for international candidates
- Add buffer time for technical issues

### Planning Review Sessions

- Schedule reviews **1-2 days after deadline**
- Block time when most completions are expected
- Use peak activity data to predict volume

---

## Timezone Handling

### For International Candidates

1. **Use relative time** - "within 7 days" vs specific date/time
2. **Specify timezone** - If using specific times, include timezone
3. **Consider work hours** - Avoid sending at odd hours in their timezone

### Deadline Display

The platform shows deadlines in the candidate's local timezone automatically.

## Automating Follow-ups

### Using Bulk Actions

1. Filter candidates by status (Invited, not started)
2. Select all matching candidates
3. Use bulk action to send reminder
4. Track open and click rates

### Scheduling Tips

- Set calendar reminders for follow-up days
- Review non-responders before each reminder
- Remove candidates who have started from reminder lists
