## Timezone Handling

### For International Candidates

1. **Use relative time** - "within 7 days" vs specific date/time
2. **Specify timezone** - If using specific times, include timezone
3. **Consider work hours** - Send emails during their working hours

### Deadline Display

The platform shows deadlines in the candidate's local timezone automatically.
