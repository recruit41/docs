# Five-Step Interview Design

Design your interview plan using the five-step process: Overview & Objectives, Module Structure, Evaluation Criteria, Proctoring Settings, and Run Simulation.

!!! warning "Important"
    You must create an Interview Plan before you can invite candidates or make a job public.

---

## What is an Interview Plan?

An Interview Plan is your blueprint for how the AI should conduct interviews. It includes:

- **Interview Structure** - The sections and order of the interview
- **Questions and Topics** - What the AI should ask about
- **Evaluation Criteria** - How candidates should be scored
- **Settings** - Proctoring rules and candidate instructions

---

## The Five-Step Process

| Step | Purpose | What You Do |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Overview & Objectives** | Define what you're assessing | Write a clear interview objective |
| **2. Module Structure** | Build interview stages | Add sections, questions, topics |
| **3. Evaluation Criteria** | Set scoring standards | Define rubrics and scales |
| **4. Proctoring Settings** | Configure security | Enable camera, screen share, etc. |
| **5. Run Simulation** | Test before launch | Preview the candidate experience |

---

## Step 1: Overview & Objectives

The Interview Objective tells the AI what to assess. This is **critical** for relevant question generation.

*The Interview Design Overview showing the objective, structure summary, and evaluation criteria.*

### Writing a Good Objective

**Do:**

- Be specific about skills to assess
- List 3-5 key competencies
- Include both technical AND soft skills
- Mention culture fit elements if relevant

**Don't:**

- Use vague terms like "good fit"
- Write long paragraphs
- Focus only on technical abilities

!!! success "Good Objective Example"
    *"Assess SQL proficiency, data visualization skills, communication clarity, and problem-solving approach for a customer-facing analytics role."*

!!! failure "Poor Objective Example"
    *"Find a good data analyst who can do the job well."*

## Step 2: Module Structure

### The Three-Panel Layout

| Panel | Position | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Section Library** | Left | Available sections you can add |
| **Plan Canvas** | Center | Your interview structure |
| **Property Inspector** | Right | Edit the selected section |

![Interview Design Structure](../../assets/images/recruiter/interview-design-structure.png)

*The Structure tab showing interview sections with their types and durations.*

### Typical Interview Stages

| Stage | Purpose | Duration |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Introduction** | Warm up, explain process | 2-5 min |
| **Background Q&A** | Learn about experience | 10-15 min |
| **Technical Questions** | Assess domain knowledge | 10-20 min |
| **Coding Challenge** | Evaluate problem-solving | 20-30 min |
| **Candidate Q&A** | Answer their questions | 5 min |
| **Closing** | Wrap up, next steps | 2-3 min |

### Section Types Available

| Module Type | Best For | Features |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Multiple Choice Q&A** | Knowledge screening | Auto-graded, quick |
| **Code Pad** | Technical assessment | Live coding, syntax highlighting |
| **Video Response** | Behavioral questions | Async, reviewable |
| **Async Task** | Take-home assignments | Deadline-based |
| **Case Study** | Problem-solving | Document analysis |
| **Live Deep Dive** | In-depth discussion | Real-time interaction |

!!! info "Duration Limit"
    Total interview cannot exceed **60 minutes**.

---

## Step 3: Evaluation Criteria

### Criteria Types

| Type | Badge | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Interview-wide** | Purple | Applies to entire interview |
| **Section-specific** | Blue | Applies only to one section |

### Scoring Scales

| Scale Type | When to Use | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1-5 Scale** | Nuanced assessment | 1=Poor, 3=Meets, 5=Exceeds |
| **Pass/Fail** | Binary requirements | Must-have qualifications |
| **Percentage** | Quantitative tasks | Code test accuracy |
| **Rubric** | Detailed evaluation | Multi-level descriptions |

---

## Step 4: Proctoring Settings

### Live Meeting Checks

| Setting | Default | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Require Camera** | ON | Candidates must keep camera on |
| **Require Screen Share** | OFF | Candidates must share entire screen |
| **External Monitor Detection** | OFF | Flag if candidate connects extra display |

### Pre-Meeting Checks

| Check | What It Verifies |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Browser** | Supported browser (Chrome recommended) |
| **Camera** | Camera is working |
| **Microphone** | Mic is working |
| **Network** | Stable internet connection |

### Proctoring Guidelines by Role Type

| Role Type | Recommended Settings |
| :--- | :--- |
| Entry-level | Camera only |
| Mid-level | Camera + Screen share |
| Senior/Leadership | Camera + Screen share + Monitor detection |
| High-security | All options enabled |

---

## Step 5: Run Simulation

!!! danger "Never launch without testing!"
    Always run a simulation before inviting real candidates.

### What to Check

| Check | What to Look For |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Timer** | Countdown works, warnings appear |
| **Navigation** | Next/back buttons work |
| **Questions** | Text renders correctly |
| **Attachments** | Images load, files downloadable |
| **Code Editor** | Syntax highlighting works |
| **Video** | Camera prompt appears |
| **Submission** | Final submit works |

## Best Practices

1. **Keep it under 60 minutes** - Attention drops after an hour
2. **Start with easy questions** - Help candidates warm up
3. **Include mandatory questions** - Ensure consistency
4. **Test with simulations** - Always test before going live
5. **Set clear criteria** - Makes scoring more objective
