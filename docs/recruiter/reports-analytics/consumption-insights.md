## Forecasting Usage

### Planning Tips

1. **Review historical data** - Look at past months to predict future needs
2. **Account for seasonality** - Hiring often peaks at certain times
3. **Buffer for growth** - Add 20% for unexpected hiring needs

### Example Calculation

If you typically hire for 5 roles per month with 50 candidates each:

```
5 roles × 50 candidates × 30% completion rate = 75 credits/month
```
