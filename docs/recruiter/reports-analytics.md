## Using Analytics Effectively

1. **Monitor funnel drop-off** - If many candidates drop out at a specific stage, investigate why
2. **Track score trends** - Consistently low scores may indicate sourcing issues
3. **Optimize timing** - Schedule reviews during your peak activity periods
4. **Plan capacity** - Use consumption data to forecast hiring needs
