## Applying the Golden Rule

### Ask These Questions

Before assigning access:

1. **What does this person need to do?**
   - View candidates only? → **Viewer** role on the job
   - Manage candidate pipeline? → **Recruiter** role on the job
   - Design interviews and manage team? → **Job Owner** role on the job
   - Manage all users and settings? → **Account Admin**

2. **Which openings do they need access to?**
   - All openings? → Account Admin (automatic access) or add to each opening
   - Specific openings only? → Add as a team member on those openings

3. **Is this access temporary?**
   - Set a reminder to review and revoke if needed

### Common Scenarios

| Scenario | Recommended Access |
| :--- | :--- |
| New recruiter onboarding | **Recruiter** on assigned openings |
| Hiring manager for one role | **Job Owner** on their opening |
| HR administrator | **Account Admin** |
| External recruitment agency | **Recruiter** on limited openings only |
| Department lead reviewing results | **Viewer** on relevant openings |

## Regular Access Reviews

!!! info "Best Practice"
    Review team access quarterly to ensure it still aligns with current responsibilities.

- Remove access for team members who have left
- Downgrade roles for those who no longer need elevated privileges
- Audit who has access to sensitive roles (executive searches, etc.)
- Use the **Role Guide** in the platform to remind yourself of each role's permissions
