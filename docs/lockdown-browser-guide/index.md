## Setup Walkthrough

### 1. Welcome Screen

![Welcome Screen](../assets/images/lockdown-browser/01-welcome.png)

When the app opens, you'll see the Welcome screen. It confirms three things:

- The setup takes about **2 minutes**
- We'll test your **camera and microphone**
- Your **privacy is our priority**

Click **Get Started** to begin.

---

### 2. Privacy & Monitoring

![Privacy & Monitoring](../assets/images/lockdown-browser/02-privacy-consent.png)

This screen explains what the app monitors during your interview:

- **Screen activity** — We check for prohibited applications but do not record your screen content
- **Camera & Microphone** — Video and audio are shared only during the interview with your interviewer
- **Running processes** — We check for cheating tools (e.g., remote desktop, AI assistants). We do not access your files or personal data

!!! info "Privacy"
    Monitoring data is only collected during your interview session and retained per our data policy.

Read through each item, check the **consent checkbox**, then click **I Agree & Continue**.

If you'd rather not proceed, click "I'd rather not proceed" to exit.

---

### 3. Camera Check

![Camera Check](../assets/images/lockdown-browser/03-camera.png)

The app requests camera access so your AI interviewer can see you during the conversation.

**Tips for a good camera setup:**
- Make sure your face is **well-lit** (avoid backlighting)
- Position yourself in the **center** of the frame
- Check that your **background** is appropriate

When everything looks good, click **Looks Good, Continue**.

!!! warning "Important"
    If the camera doesn't activate, click "Open System Settings" and grant camera permission to Recruit41, then return to the app.

---

### 4. Microphone Check

![Microphone Check](../assets/images/lockdown-browser/04-microphone.png)

Say something like **"Hello, this is a test"** and watch the audio level bars respond. The bars show your voice is being detected.

If the built-in microphone isn't working, select a different one from the **dropdown menu**.

---

### 5. Screen Recording (macOS only)

![Screen Recording Permission](../assets/images/lockdown-browser/05-screen-recording.png)

On Mac, the app needs screen recording permission. This ensures a level playing field by detecting any unauthorized assistance during your interview.

If the permission is already enabled, you'll see a **green checkmark** and can click **Continue** right away.

If not, click **Open System Settings**, enable the permission for Recruit41, then return to the app.

!!! note
    Windows users skip this step — no additional screen permissions are needed.

---

### 6. Final System Check

![System Check](../assets/images/lockdown-browser/06-system-check.png)

The system check verifies everything is ready:

- **Camera access verified** — Your camera is working
- **Microphone access verified** — Your microphone is working
- **Screen recording enabled** — Screen monitoring is active (macOS)
- **Checking running applications** — No prohibited apps detected
- **Verifying display configuration** — Single display confirmed

This usually takes a few seconds. If any check fails, you'll see instructions on how to fix it.

---

### 7. You're All Set!

![Ready Screen](../assets/images/lockdown-browser/07-ready.png)

When all checks pass, you'll see the **Ready** screen with a green checkmark and a summary:

- Camera working
- Microphone working
- Screen monitoring active
- No prohibited apps detected
- Single display verified

Click **Start Interview** to enter secure mode and begin your AI-powered interview.

!!! danger "Caution"
    Once you start the interview, the app enters **secure mode**. You won't be able to switch apps or use other applications until the interview is complete.
